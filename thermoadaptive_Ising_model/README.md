Codes simulating the thermoadaptive Ising model on d-dimensional lattices with K-type thermal interactions. 
When K=0 this is equivalent to the classic Ising model on the d=2 square lattice, undergoing the classic continuous ferro-paramagnetic transition. 
If K>0, the model undergoes mixed-order transitions due to the propagation of systemic cascades with (K even) and without (K odd) parity invariance.
